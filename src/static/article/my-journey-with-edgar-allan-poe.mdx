## Embracing The Tell-Tale Heart

Under the direct guidance of Iswadi Pratama, I was given the opportunity to perform a monologue based on Edgar Allan Poe's chilling story, "The Tell-Tale Heart." The experience of immersing myself in the mind of a narrator plagued by guilt and paranoia was both challenging and exhilarating. Iswadi's mentorship allowed me to delve into the depths of the character, exploring the psychological turmoil that defines Poe's writing.

My gratitude towards Iswadi Pratama extends beyond the realm of acting. His mentorship has taught me more than just how to portray a character on stage; he imparted invaluable life lessons, emphasizing the importance of empathy, dedication, and a deep understanding of the human condition. Through the lens of Poe's narratives, Iswadi taught me to appreciate the complexity of emotions and the power of storytelling to evoke them.

Fuelled by my growing fascination with Edgar Allan Poe's work, I embarked on a new chapter of my journey: directing. Armed with the knowledge and guidance acquired during my time with Iswadi Pratama, I took on the challenge of bringing another Poe masterpiece to life.
