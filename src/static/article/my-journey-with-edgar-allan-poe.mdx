# My Journey Learning Edgar Allan Poe: From Acting to Directing

## Introduction

The journey of exploring the literary works of Edgar Allan Poe has been a transformative experience for me. From my early acting days at Titimangsa Foundation under the guidance of Iswadi Pratama, to eventually directing monologue performances based on Poe's iconic tales, my connection with his macabre and mysterious stories has evolved in ways I could never have imagined.

## A Beginnings in Acting with Iswadi Pratama

My journey into the world of Edgar Allan Poe began during my acting training at Titimangsa Foundation, led by the talented Iswadi Pratama. Iswadi's unique approach to theatre not only honed my acting skills but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the nuances of storytelling. Little did I know that this foundation would lead me to explore the works of one of the most celebrated literary figures in history.

## Embracing The Tell-Tale Heart

Under the direct guidance of Iswadi Pratama, I was given the opportunity to perform a monologue based on Edgar Allan Poe's chilling story, "The Tell-Tale Heart." The experience of immersing myself in the mind of a narrator plagued by guilt and paranoia was both challenging and exhilarating. Iswadi's mentorship allowed me to delve into the depths of the character, exploring the psychological turmoil that defines Poe's writing.

## Learning Beyond Acting

My gratitude towards Iswadi Pratama extends beyond the realm of acting. His mentorship has taught me more than just how to portray a character on stage; he imparted invaluable life lessons, emphasizing the importance of empathy, dedication, and a deep understanding of the human condition. Through the lens of Poe's narratives, Iswadi taught me to appreciate the complexity of emotions and the power of storytelling to evoke them.

## Venturing into Directing

Fuelled by my growing fascination with Edgar Allan Poe's work, I embarked on a new chapter of my journey: directing. Armed with the knowledge and guidance acquired during my time with Iswadi Pratama, I took on the challenge of bringing another Poe masterpiece to life. I chose "The Black Cat" as my canvas and collaborated with the talented Selma Jasmine to create a captivating monologue performance.

## The Performance

The culmination of my efforts took shape in the form of a monologue performance of "The Black Cat." Set in the atmospheric surroundings of Gedung Rumentang Siang, Bandung, the performance was a collaboration with Luang Waktu Production. The haunting tale of guilt and descent into madness was brought to life through Selma Jasmine's exceptional acting, embodying the turmoil of the protagonist with a raw intensity that left the audience spellbound.

## Conclusion

My journey learning Edgar Allan Poe has been a multifaceted exploration of literature, acting, and storytelling. From my early days at Maestro Theatre under the guidance of Iswadi Pratama to directing my own monologue performance, every step has deepened my appreciation for Poe's timeless narratives. I am indebted to Iswadi for not only enhancing my acting skills but for imparting life lessons that extend far beyond the stage. As I continue to grow as an artist, I carry with me the indelible influence of Poe's words and Iswadi's teachings, driving me to explore the boundless possibilities of artistic expression.
