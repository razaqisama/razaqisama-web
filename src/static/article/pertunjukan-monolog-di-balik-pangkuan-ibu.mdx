The art of theater has the remarkable ability to evoke emotions, challenge perspectives, and bring hidden stories to light. In a world where understanding and compassion are often lacking, "Di Balik Pangkuan Ibu" emerges as a poignant monologue stage performance that delves into the complexities of human life and relationships. This article chronicles the creative journey of both writing and directing this thought-provoking play, which highlights the theme of redemption, compassion, and the universal right to live free of judgment.

## A Glimpse into the Premise:

"Di Balik Pangkuan Ibu," which translates to "Behind a Mother's Embrace," presents an unconventional yet deeply resonant story. The narrative centers around a prostitute who aspires to give a better life to a child who is not biologically hers. Amidst societal judgments and self-doubt, she grapples with the fear of inadvertently perpetuating her own lifestyle onto the innocent child. The storyline encapsulates the raw emotional journey of love, acceptance, and the desire to break free from the cycle of judgment.

## The Dual Role of Writer and Director:

Undertaking the roles of both writer and director for this monologue stage performance was no small feat. The writer-director navigated the creative process with the aim of seamlessly blending the emotional depth of the narrative with the visual and auditory elements of the stage. This dual responsibility allowed for an intimate connection with the characters and their emotions, ensuring that every word spoken and every movement made on stage conveyed the intended message.

Bringing out the internal struggles of the protagonist required a delicate balance of physical expressions, vocal inflections, and the strategic use of pauses.

The partnership between the creator and Lakon Theatre provided a platform to realize the vision of "Di Balik Pangkuan Ibu." The theater's commitment to promoting meaningful narratives aligned perfectly with the themes of the performance. The collaboration ensured that the technical aspects, such as lighting, set design, and soundscapes, enhanced the emotional resonance of the monologue.

## The Message of Empathy and Dignity:

Through the complex journey of the protagonist, the audience is invited to challenge their preconceived notions and extend understanding to those who lead lives divergent from their own. The performance aims to ignite conversations about societal judgments, the importance of second chances, and the capacity for change in every individual.
